                <h3>Economic Research & Data Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    One of my primary passions is economic research and data analysis. In today's data driven world, 
                    the ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets has become increasingly valuable. 
                    I've spent considerable time learning statistical programming languages like Python, which 
                    have become essential tools in modern economic analysis. Through my coursework and independent 
                    projects, I've worked on analyzing various economic datasets, from unemployment trends to consumer 
                    spending patterns, using econometric techniques to identify relationships and test hypotheses.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    What excites me most about economic research is the detective work involved in formulating questions, 
                    gathering evidence, and piecing together narratives that help explain economic phenomena. I recently 
                    started a research project examining the impact of health and education on countries around the world,
                    whichs requires collecting data from multiple sources, cleaning and organizing it, and creating 
                    visualizations for our analysis. This process is teaching me how to collect and sort data and 
                    present it in a clear way to audiences.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Beyond the technical aspects, I'm deeply interested in behavioral economics, the study of psychological, 
                    cognitive, and emotional factors that influence economic decisions. The work of economists like Daniel 
                    Kahneman and Richard Thaler has shown that people don't always behave as the rational actors assumed in 
                    traditional economic models. Understanding these behavioral insights is crucial for designing better 
                    policies and business strategies. I'm particularly fascinated by how nudges and choice architecture can 
                    be used to help people make better financial decisions without restricting their freedom of choice.
