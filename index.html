                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Henri Pulake, and I am currently an economics student at Northeastern University 
                        in Boston, Massachusetts. I've always been fascinated by how economic principles shape our daily 
                        lives, from the decisions individuals make about spending and saving to the policies that governments 
                        implement to manage entire economies. My journey into economics began in high school when I first 
                        learned about supply and demand curves, and I was immediately hooked by the logical elegance of 
                        economic theory combined with its real-world applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Northeastern, I've had the opportunity to dive deep into various areas of economics, including 
                        microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, and behavioral economics. One of the aspects I enjoy 
                        most about studying economics is its interdisciplinary natureâ€”it draws from mathematics, psychology, 
                        political science, and even philosophy. Through my coursework, I've developed strong analytical and 
                        quantitative skills, learning to work with statistical software, analyze large datasets, and build 
                        economic models that help explain complex phenomena.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond academics, I'm particularly interested in development economics and understanding how economic 
                        growth can be achieved in emerging markets. I believe that sound economic policies have the power to 
                        lift millions out of poverty and create opportunities for future generations. I'm also passionate about 
                        financial literacy and have volunteered to teach basic economic concepts to high school students in the 
                        Boston area. After graduation, I hope to work in economic consulting or policy analysis, where I can 
                        apply my knowledge to solve real-world problems and contribute to evidence-based decision making.
                    </p>
