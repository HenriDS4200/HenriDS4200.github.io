                    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
    Hello! I'm Henri Pulake, a fourth-year student at Northeastern University pursuing my Master's in Economics with a minor in Data Science. Economics has always fascinated me because it's everywhere in the decisions we make every day, in the policies that shape our communities, and in the global trends that affect us all. What really drew me in was how economics combines rigorous analytical thinking with real-world impact.
</p>
<p>
    At Northeastern, I've gotten to explore so many interesting areas like microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics, and behavioral economics, just to name a few. What I love most is how economics doesn't exist in a vacuum. It pulls from math, psychology, political science, and even philosophy. My data science minor has been a perfect complement, giving me the technical skills to actually dig into large datasets and build models that can explain complex patterns. There's something really satisfying about turning raw numbers into meaningful insights.
</p>
<p>
    Outside of coursework, I'm particularly drawn to development economics and understanding how countries grow, how inequality develops, and what policies can actually make a difference. I really believe that smart economic policies can change lives and create opportunities for people who need them most. I've also spent some time volunteering to teach financial literacy to high school students around Boston, which has been incredibly rewarding. After I graduate, I'm hoping to work in economic consulting or policy analysis, somewhere I can put what I've learned to work on problems that matter.
